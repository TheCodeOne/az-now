I migrated Allianz's [Berufs­unfähigkeits­versicherung Rechner](https://www.allianz.de/vorsorge/berufsunfaehigkeitsversicherung/rechner/#!/home) from AngularJS to Angular 18. This involved reverse engineering the existing API and utilizing Allianz's "aquilla" component library.

My goal was to demonstrate that such a migration could be completed efficiently with minimal effort in a short timeframe.

The migration took around three hours.
